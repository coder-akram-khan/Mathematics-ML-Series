Welcome to the **Mathematics ML Series**!  
This repository is dedicated to exploring the mathematics and statistics that form the backbone of Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Analysis.  

### ðŸš€ About the Series
This series is designed to strengthen your foundational knowledge by covering key concepts such as:
- Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode
- Probability and Distributions
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus for Machine Learning
- Statistical Hypothesis Testing
- And much more to come!

Weâ€™re just getting started and will continue to expand the content over time. Stay tuned for regular updates!

### ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- **CentralTendency/**: Covers mean, median, and mode with Python examples.
- **RangeFunction.ipynb**: Demonstrates how to calculate the range (difference between the maximum and minimum values) using Python's built-in functions, NumPy, and visualized with Matplotlib.
  ![Range Histogram](https://github.com/coder-akram-khan/Mathematics-ML-Series/blob/main/assets/range_histogram.png?raw=true)
- **README.md**: Overview of the project.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies.
